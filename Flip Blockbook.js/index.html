            a boy named Momo who discovers a planet suitable for life, but no one believes him until a mysterious event
            changes everything.

            Momo was a small, curious boy with a big interest in the stars and
            planets. Every night, he would sit beneath the blanket of the dark
            sky, his telescope tracking across the heavens.
          </p>
          <p>
            He studied constellations, noted the changing phases of the moon
            and dreamt of discoveries yet to be made. His notebooks were
            filled with sketches, notes, and questions.

        <div class="scriptDiv">
          <p>
            One night, Momo spotted something unusual in a far-off galaxy. A
            tiny green speck, barely visible. But there was something about it
            that intrigued him instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Momo started researching about that green speck and found that it
            had the potential to support life, a fact that excited him
            immensely.

            He wasted no time and told everyone about his discovery. However,
            nobody believed him, dismissing it as a product of his overly
            imaginative mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Days turned into weeks, but Momo never lost hope. Disheartened yet
            determined, he continued his observation of the mysterious green
            speck.

            One day, something unexpected happened. To Momo's surprise, the
            green speck started to glow brighter and it seemed to be getting
            bigger.
          </p>
          <p>
            The news spread around the town, and people started to crowd
            around Momo's house to see the spectacle. They soon realised that
            Momo's discovery was indeed real.

            Many were astonished and regretted not believing Momo. The boy,
            however, was more interested in the fact that his discovery was
            finally acknowledged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientists came to their small town and set up huge telescopes.
            They confirmed that Momo had indeed discovered a new planet.

            The news of Momo's discovery made headlines. He was lauded for his
            steadfast belief and innovative thinking despite the scepticism he
            faced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Momo was given awards and showered with praises. But what he loved
            most were the opportunities to learn and interact with the
            scientists.

            The scientists named the planet "Momo's World" in honour of its
            young discoverer. Momo, watching all this, was over the moon with
            joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The green speck in the sky, now known as Momo's World, became a
            symbol of hope and determination for all the town's people.

            filled with wonder.

            Meanwhile, scientists were making plans to send a probe to Momo's
            World, fuelling the excitement of all the town's people, including
            Momo.

            Months passed as they waited for the probe to reach Momo's World
            and send back data. It was a time of anticipation, wonder, and a
            bit of worry.
